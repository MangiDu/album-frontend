ALBUM ONLINE
=======================

It's a project about my graduation paper. The goal of this project is just as its name -- managing photos online. This project is my first one, not only for grauduation paper but also to practise my inexperienced skills, :). The project is still a mess beacause of my uncomplete knowledge structure and poor coding ability. Well, I'll keep working on, learning while coding.
